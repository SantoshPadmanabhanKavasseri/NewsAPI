In the above code, the /register route handles user registration. It checks if the user already exists, hashes the password using bcrypt, and stores the user in the users array.

The /login route handles user login. It checks if the user exists, compares the provided password with the stored hashed password using bcrypt, and if they match, generates a JWT token using jsonwebtoken.

The /protected route is an example of a protected route that requires authentication. It uses the authenticateToken middleware to check if the token provided in the Authorization header is valid and then allows access to the protected route.

You can run this code using Node.js, and the server will start on http://localhost:3000. You can then make HTTP requests to the /register, /login, and /protected routes to test the functionality.
